Big O - WORST CASE SCENARIO. PERTAINS TO HOW EFFICIENT WE CAN RUN OUR CODE. THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND MONEY YOU CAN SAVE FOR A COMPANY IS CRITICAL.


Three pillars of Code 

1. Readable clean code that others can read and is maintainable 
2. Speed (Standard practice of correct data structures)
3. Memory - if it uses a lot of memory, depending on the machine it might pose a problem. 
    -Space complexity vs Time complexity 


1. Readable 

2. Scalable 
    a. Speed
    b. Memory

Computers run based on speed and memory

Two parts of a program when it executes 

1. Heap - where we store variables/values we assign 

2. Stack - where we keep track of our function calls 

*Sometimes it's better to use less memory instead of less time and vice versa
